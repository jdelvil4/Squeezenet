# Squeezenet
Squeezenet Machine Learning (ML) project

General Overview

This code provides a demonstration of the Intel OpenVINO toolkit and its ability to perform image classification by using the Squeezenet Machine Learning model. Implemented as a Python language project and stored using Jupyter Notebook, this project demonstrates the powerful capabilities of the model in both single and burst image classification. 


This project in totality includes:

Python 3.x

OpenVINO toolkit

OpenCV

Matplotlib

NumPy

SqueezeNet 1.1

Project features:

Squeezenet model loaded in OpenVINO IR format

Processes and classifies single and batch input images

Utilizes label mapping to display top-N prediction probabilities, listed by top 10 results

Modular (preprocessing, inference, and display functions present)

Output of layer-level performance metrics

Note on file usage!

Image and model files reference throughout the code are not included, modify at your own discretion based on files and needs
